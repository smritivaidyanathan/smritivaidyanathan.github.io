# Hi, I'm Smriti!

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Columbia University, conducting research at the New York Genome Center in the Knowles Lab. My work focuses on developing deep learning models for integrative analysis of gene expression and alternative splicing in single-cell transcriptomic data.

Previously, I earned my Sc.B. in Computational Biology from Brown University, where I studied alternative splicing regulation by RNA-binding protein condensates using computational analysis of bioimages.

## Projects

### [MultiVI-Splice](https://github.com/smritivaidyanathan/scvi-tools-splicing)  
Fork of `scvi-tools` extending MultiVI to jointly model gene expression and splicing.  
Also includes a single-modality splicing VAE built with a partial encoder and linear decoder.

### [Remembering to Learn: A Brain-Inspired Approach to Catastrophic Forgetting in AI](https://github.com/smritivaidyanathan/fly-model-continual-learning-extensions)  
Final project for Columbia Engineering. Extended FlyModel with BI-R, EWC, and cascade synapses to improve continual learning on CIFAR-100. Cascade synapses notably reduced memory loss without replay.

### Mama’s Pastaria (VR Game) 
Final group project for Columbia’s COMS W4172: 3D User Interfaces and Augmented Reality.  
A Unity-based VR cooking simulator where players prepare pasta dishes for customers using interactive mechanics inspired by Papa’s Pizzeria and Cooking Mama.

### Brain Tumor Segmentation and Survival Prediction (BRATS 2020) 
Final group project for Columbia’s COMS W4995 005: Deep Learning for Computer Vision.  
Segmented tumor regions and predicted survival outcomes from BRATS 2020 MRI scans using U-Net and ResNet-based models.

### [3D Speckle Volume Quantifier](https://github.com/smritivaidyanathan/3D_Speckle_Volume_Quantifier)  
Custom analysis tool developed for my undergraduate honors thesis at Brown University.  
Quantifies nuclear speckle volumes from confocal z-stacks to study how the GA-binding transcription factor CLAMP influences splicing condensate formation in *Drosophila* embryos.

### [Desktop World](https://github.com/smritivaidyanathan/desktop-world)  
Final group project for Brown’s CSCI 1230: Computer Graphics.  
A procedurally generated snow globe–like world featuring terrain, particle systems, boids, custom shaders, and selective bloom effects.  
Live demo: [desktop-world.netlify.app](https://desktop-world.netlify.app/)  

### [WordleTerminal](https://github.com/smritivaidyanathan/WordleTerminal)  
A terminal-based clone of NYT Wordle, built for fun in Python.
